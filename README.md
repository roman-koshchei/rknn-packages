# RKNN Wheel

To work with RKNN through python you will need to use their wheel, provided in [official repository](https://github.com/airockchip/rknn-toolkit2).

To simplify use I forked repository and only left wheel files as well as default license.
No need to copy whole repository and easier to find those files.

Straightforward folder structure:

- `lite` - rknn-toolkit-lite2
- `arm64` - rknn-toolkit2 arm64
- `x86_64` - rknn-toolkit2 x86_64
